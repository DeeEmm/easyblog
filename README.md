Welcome to the EasyDiscuss community support repository.

This repository is managed by the the Open Source community and aims to provide support, bugfixes and compatibility updates to allow EasyBlog users to maintain websites that use EasyBlog and realated StackIdeas products

This repository was created in response to the lack of proper support and updates provided by StackIdeas under thier subscription plans. The general consensus within the community is that subscription costs are not worth the money as they no longer release updates to their products. This leaves users that have made considerable investments into integrating StackIdeas products into their community websites with an uncertain future.

## Project Goals

The aim of this project is to provide ongoing support for StackIdeas products and provide bug fix and compatibility updates to allow community users to maintain websites that currently rely on these products. This project is a community run and supported endeavour. Its sole aim is to help provide those of us who have websites that rely on StackIdeas products to be able to continue to run our websites into the foreseeable future. This need is largely driven by the lack of an alternative product to migrate to.  

The initial aim is to fix compatibility issues with the existing products and address outstanding bug reports. Long term it is hoped that the products may evolve with new features.
